# Church attendance App

## Tech Stack

2. KivyMD - This 
3. Kivy
4. MongoDB

## Proposed Plan

### Creating Screens
As far as the scope is concerned here we will decide on functionality based on the screens required.

#### Attendance Screen
This screen allows you to create an attendance entry. For Example, you want to track attendance for recurring event say a class or course. The idea would be to create a unique ID for this event. Selecting this attendance routes  to a screen with all the required attendees.

#### Attendees Screen
The Attendees screen will contain a list of attendees where attendance can be marked and submitted.

## Installation steps
1. You would have got an `.exe` file and a `.env` file
2. The `.exe` file is your application while the `.env` file is the file that allows you to connect to a particular database or shift between application modes and admin modes.
3. We start by first setting up the database. Go to the below website and setup your free database accordingly.
4. To Switch between Admin mode and applicate just set false or true in the .env files
