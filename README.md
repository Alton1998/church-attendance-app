## Proposed Plan

### Creating Screens
As far as the scope is concerned here we will decide on functionality based on the screens required.

#### Attendance Screen
This screen allows you to create an attendance entry. For Example, you want to track attendance for recurring event say a class or course. The idea would be to create a unique ID for this event. Selecting this attendance routes  to a screen with all the required attendees.

#### Attendees Screen
The Attendees screen will contain a list of attendees where attendance can be marked and submitted.

## Installation steps
1. You would have got an `.exe` file and a `.env` file
2. The `.exe` file is your application while the `.env` file is the file that allows you to connect to a particular database or shift between application modes and admin modes.
3. We start by first setting up the database. Go to the below website and setup your free database accordingly.
